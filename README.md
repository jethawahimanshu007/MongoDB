# MongoDB
This project consists of python script to download tweets and queries in MongoDB to demonstrate how to use MongoDB for querying of data.
Tweets are downloaded by using the python script. They are then loaded in MongoDB by using the MongoImport utility. 
Finally queries are done on them for different analysis like tweets contatining certain keywords, tweets having 40 retweets or more and so forth and so on.
